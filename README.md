# RAG-System: FastAPI, React, and Vercel

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload documents and ask questions about their content. It's built with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and is designed for deployment on Vercel's serverless platform.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Document Upload:** Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file uploads.
- **Semantic Search:** Uses a vector database for efficient, meaning-based search.
- **LLM Integration:** Powered by Gemini (or other user-selected models) for generating answers.
- **Model Customization:** Allows users to select the LLM and adjust settings like temperature.
- **Serverless-Optimized:** Built with Vercel's free-tier limitations in mind.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI, LangChain, Python
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
- **Vector Database:** FAISS (for local development), with plans for a managed service like Pinecone or Weaviate for production.
